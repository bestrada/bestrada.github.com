                        <h2>Susan</h2>
                        <p>
                          Hi, I’m Susan and this is Prashant, Theresa, Siva and Bryan.<br>
                          The ceremony was so sweet, it’s amazing we aren’t all still cryin’.<br>
                          So, here we are the group that Andrew calls the fam,<br>
                          and we’re all here to tell you why Andrew is the man.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          For 3 years, we used to work together at Microsoft in Mountain View,<br>
                          though the number of days that we weren’t together were just a few.<br>
                          Every day, we carpooled to work and went out to lunch,<br>
                          We even had a sleepover because we didn’t see enough of this bunch.<br>
                          Group halloween costumes, secret santas, elaborate birthdays were how we liked to roll,<br>
                          but I have to say, that of the group, Andrew was the heart and soul.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          So some might say that Andrew is an intense fella,<br>
                          but to us, we lovingly know that Andrew is just a bit “hella.”<br>
                          He even dubbed the two us, when we hung out, Team Huwang.<br>
                          On one of our hangouts, I noticed he was singing a new sweet song.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          He told me about this great girl, and I thought wow, could this be true?<br>
                          Could this girl be just as hella as Andrew?<br>
                          Their first date turned into a 5 stop walking food tour,<br>
                          so that’s how I knew how he could be so sure.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          An 8-hour date meant Andrew finally found his match,<br>
                          I knew this intense, hella foodie girl was definitely a catch!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                          Even now, Andrew brings the same intensity to our friendship.<br>
                          One day, while we were biking through the park at quite a clip,<br>
                          I showed him a hidden bike track, a diamond in the rough.<br>
                          Perfect for Andrew, because an easy ride is not nearly enough.<br>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          His excitement overtook him, and he raced around the cement.<br>
                          “Maybe this was a bad idea,” I started to lament.<br>
                          He suggested we do a couple of laps, which somehow turned into nine.<br>
                          The next time we rode, we pushed for a dozen, which on their own seemed fine.<br>
                          But Of course we finished the rest of the ride, because exhaustion would never stop Andrew<br>
                          Then without missing a beat, he turned a post-ride bite into a fun meal with the crew.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          And that meal had fried fish, rice pudding, beignets, and two bahn mis<br>
                          Basically we scoured the city for whatever we could shove in our tummies<br>
                          As Andrew headed home for his next meal, and I was about to collapse,<br>
                          he told me don't worry, next time we'll do even more laps.

                        <h2>article section h2</h2>
                        <p>
                          Let me tell you a story of Andrew’s intense love and passion for.. food<br>
                          It takes place in New Zealand, where tender lamb and oysters set the mood<br>
                          Our first night out, Andrew found these diamond clams that were so amazing, we had a second plate.<br>
                          We devoured them all, except for the two lonely closed ones that wondered if anyone would take the bait.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          But Andrew will leave no man, or clam, behind!<br>
                          A more loyal (or hungry) fellow, you’ll never find.<br>
                          He took a butter knife, cracked them open, and won that battle<br>
                          The next day, however, the revenge of clams made sure his stomach felt a rattle.<br>
                          You see, closed clams are typically not safe to eat.<br>
                          But don’t worry, Andrew and his love of food will never be beat.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Andrew, Mary, and I grew closer throughout this New Zealand trip<br>
                          Helicopter rides and black water rafting really cemented our friendship.<br>
                          On the last night, Andrew and Mary were so sweet to invite me to their dinner date<br>
                          I realized quickly that I was welcome not only as a friend, but as a third shared plate!

                        <h2>Siva</h2>
                        <p>
                          I’m Andrew’s old roommate and so I know him quite well.<br>
                          The passion and intensity he carried wrapped you up as those who know him can tell.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          My first meeting with this fellow was on route to a party with many a friend<br>
                          I couldn’t help humming the Disney song A Whole New World; I like Disney, I can’t pretend.<br>
                          Now for this hummed show most folk would stare and the awkwardness spikes<br>
                          But Andrew and I belted; shoulder to shoulder swaying as we traded verses in our air mics.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          Now I knew this man was someone to keep close, so I joined him as his roommate<br>
                          I like a good adventure and had plenty from Andrew’s intensity that does not abate.<br>
                          Though his interests were varied there was one that maintained: food<br>
                          One memorable instance, was our ramen making which I joined not to be rude.<br>
                          The morning after the first time, I could see the joy on his face and knew we’d make quite a few<br>
                          It must have been ten or fifteen times until we hit his recipe: double meat, lots of egg, extra veggies, fully loaded as only Andrew can do.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          A great tradition we had as roommates was watching comedy nights, thursdays, on tv<br>
                          Andrew was unsurprisingly “hella” but frankly looking forward to those nights gave me glee<br>
                          Around this time I met Mary and she gave me a nickname that she still fondly uses: Nemesis<br>
                          Why you ask?  For her she felt competition for Andrew’s attention from me and she was going to win this.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          What she didn’t understand was that I wasn’t battling because there was a clear victor to this thing<br>
                          It was obvious that Mary was the person Andrew would devote his passion and intensity to right from the beginning

                        <p>
                          One evening, Amy and Mary offered to cook dinner at their place off Polk street.<br>
                          Me, Anqi, and Landon agreed to come over to share a bite to eat.<br>
                          Before we arrived, Mary asked to us to pick up a few things at the store.<br>
                          Anqi and I drove out to the Sunset to retrieve what she asked for.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          After we left the market, Anqi remembered a missing ingredient much to his dismay.<br>
                          He said “let’s just go back to my house, it’s totally on the way”.<br>
                          If you know Anqi, you know his internal compass is a little bit obscure.<br>
                          His house was definitely out of the way; a complete detour.<br>
                          I realized what he was thinking, let me explain: no joke,<br>
                          Anqi has a special navigation scheme -- I call it “hub and spoke”.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          In his mind, he can drive back and forth from anywhere as long as he starts from his home.<br>
                          His apartment is on the way to everywhere because he touches base before he starts to roam.<br>
                          I’m not confident Anqi will ever graduate from the “I’m always lost” club,<br>
                          But I do know for Mary – she’s no longer a spoke, she’s his hub.
                        </p>
